🖼️ Image Classification using Pretrained CNN Models

This project demonstrates image classification using two popular pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models:
 ✅ ResNet50
 ✅ VGG16
Both models are uploaded in this repository, and they can be used to predict classes of input images.

✨ Features

  ✅ Uses pretrained ResNet50 and VGG16 models.
  ✅ Supports image preprocessing and resizing before predictions.
  ✅ Easy-to-use prediction scripts.
  ✅ Can be extended for transfer learning on custom datasets.

🛠️ Technologies Used

✅Python 
✅TensorFlow 
✅keras 
✅NumPy 
✅pandas 
✅Matplotlib (for visualization)
